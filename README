Functionality
-------------
Google-Docs-Sync will download all documents from your Google account into .odt files. Any documents you edit and save will be uploaded again.

Getting Started
----------------
usage: main.py [-h] {start,stop,restart,debug}

positional arguments:
  {start,stop,restart,debug}
start: Start the sync in the background
debug: Start the sync in the foreground
stop: Stop the sync?
restart: Restart the sync? What does this do?

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

You should expect to see the following output:

doriad@daviddesktop:~/Google-Docs-Sync$ ./main.py debug
Username: david.l.doria
Password:
writing: /home/doriad/Google Docs/Test Document.odt
started

(it seems to pause here, is it supposed to continue running, waiting for local or remote files to change?)

Linux
-----------
Google-Docs-Sync will create a local folder called "Google Docs" in your ~/ directory. In linux that would be home/[username], and in OS X that would be User/[username]. In Windows, I *believe* that is your My Documents folder. However, this will fail when being run under OS X or Windows. Neither of those platforms have the requisite inotify service. Inotify provides filesystem monitoring so that the sync can detect when a local file has been changed and then send those changes to Google docs.

Windows
----------------
I believe it will completely fail because Windows doesn't support the daemon module.

OS X
-----
It might properly download all the docs, but when it tries to setup the bits to watch the local filesystem, it will fail.


I would like support for those platforms. If you have the know how to accomplish this outside of Linux, please let me know!
